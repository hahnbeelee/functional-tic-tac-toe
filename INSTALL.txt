The game engine is meant to be run from the command line. You should be able to
run the game after you have downloaded and unzipped the game data folder.

After downloading the game data folder, please use the command line to unzip
the folder by following these directions...

First, navigate to the directory in which you'd like to unzip the folder using
"cd filepath" where filepath is replaced by the path to the game data folder on
your machine. Next, move the game data folder into your current directory using
"move filepath" where filepath is replaced by the path to the game data folder
on your machine. Finally, unzip the game data folder using "unzip main.zip".

After unzipping the file folder and navigating to directory of the unzipped
folder in the command line using "cd filepath" where filepath is replaced by
the path to the unzipped game data folder on your machine, type "make play" 
into the command line to start the game engine.
