We spent a lot of time thinking about implementing graphics, which we ultimately
decided against. It also took us a while to perfect writing to files due to 
multiple issues that had to be resolved with a TA. This took away from the time 
we had to implement the other parts of our system.

We realized our system was severely undersized about half way through the last 
sprint, which drove us to implement ultimate tic-tac-toe in addition to ai 
tic-tac-toe and classic tic-tac-toe.

A lot of the code we used in our ultimate tic-tac-toe implementation came from 
our classic tic-tac-toe implementation and was adapted.

Even after implementing ultimate tic-tac-toe, the process of removing duplicate 
code and improving code quality drove down the number of lines of code we had. 
For these reasons, our system is undersized.
